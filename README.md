## What?
Klutch Pickup is a easy to use tool for finding and sharing pickup sports games near you.
It a fully functional web app built with Ruby on Rails. It takes advantage of the google maps and google location api's, as well as the Twilio texting api.


## Why?
We've all had those times when we just want to play some a sport, but have no one to play with. Finding other players can be difficult even though there are lots of people out there who want to play.

## Features:
-Easy sign up.
-Quickly post games.
-Nearby players who are interested in the sport you are posting instantly get text messages with details about the pickup game you have posted.
-Smart location posting. Users simply type the name of any address or park, and the app translates that into meaningful map data automatically.

## Why Rails?
Ruby on Rails allowed us to scaffold out a backend very quickly and focus on the user experience and various api integration.
